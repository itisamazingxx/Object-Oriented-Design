## Composite Pattern

The **Composite Pattern** is used to create a tree structure of objects to represent part-whole hierarchies. This organizational structure, exemplified by a school and its departments, suggests that inheritance may not be the most appropriate solution due to the hierarchical nature of relationships.

Key features of the Composite Pattern include:
- **Tree-like Structure**: Facilitates the construction of objects in tree structures to represent the hierarchy of part and whole entities.
- **Unified Treatment**: Enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where managing a group in the same way as an individual object is necessary, highlighting its effectiveness in handling the complexity of part-whole relationships.
