### Compare to Method

 - 作用于interface, implement了interface的class强制实现
 - interface里nothing code, just decleration
  
### Abstract Class
 
 - parent class
 - **Foudation** on which to build on next specific classes
 - but itself is **too general** to have instance
 - sometimes just like regular class (but has "abstract" in decleration)
 - 任何extends了abstract class的class都可以自动继承abstract里定义过的method
